    "# BMI Calculator\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook project calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a person based on their height and weight. The project includes the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User input validation to ensure that the inputs are valid and in the correct format.\n",
    "- BMI calculation using Python based on the user's height and weight inputs.\n",
    "- Interpretation of the BMI results according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system.\n",
    "- Display of the user's BMI classification and a message indicating if they are at a health risk or not.\n",
    "- Calculation of the recommended daily calorie intake using the Harris-Benedict equation, which estimates the basal metabolic rate (BMR) based on the user's sex, age, height, and weight.\n",
    "- Display of the user's TDEE and recommended daily calorie intake based on their weight status and activity level, with the option to use a calorie deficit or surplus to help the user achieve their weight goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is designed to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for users to calculate their BMI and assess their weight status. The notebook also includes detailed explanations and comments to guide the user through each step of the calculation process.\n"
