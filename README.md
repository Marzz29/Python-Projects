# PYTHON-PROJECTS

Welcome to My Python Projects! This repository is a collection of my Python projects, including introductory projects for beginners, data analysis, machine learning, and web development. Each project is organized into its own folder within the repository structure.

# Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `README.md`: This file includes a brief description of the repository, as well as a table of contents for the different projects.

- `beginner/`: This folder contains simple projects that are suitable for beginners learning Python. Each project should include a brief description of its purpose and functionality.

- `data-analysis/`: This folder contains one or more Jupyter Notebooks that analyze data using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.). Each notebook should include a brief description of the data and the analysis.

- `machine-learning/`: This folder contains one or more Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate machine learning models using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.). Each notebook should include a brief description of the problem being solved and the machine learning model being used.

- `web-development/`: This folder contains one or more web applications built using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., Flask, Django, etc.). Each application should include a brief description of its purpose and functionality.

- `utils/`: This folder contains any helper functions or modules used in the projects.

 Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback on how I can improve or expand upon them.

 # Beginner Folder

This folder contains simple projects that are suitable for beginners learning Python. For example, a BMI calculator.

 - BMI Calculator

Description: The BMI Calculator project is a Jupyter Notebook that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight, and interpret their results using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system. Additionally, the notebook calculates the user's recommended daily calorie intake based on their weight status and activity level, using the Harris-Benedict equation.
